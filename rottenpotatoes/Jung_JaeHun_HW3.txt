  As a concerned parent
  So that I can quickly browse movies appropriate for my family
  I want to see movies matching only certain MPAA ratings

  Background: movies have been added to database # features/filter_movie_list.feature:7
    Given the following movies exist:            # features/step_definitions/movies_steps.rb:2
      | title                   | rating | release_date |

    And I am on the RottenPotatoes home page     # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:44

  Scenario: restrict to movies with 'PG' or 'R' ratings # features/filter_movie_list.feature:24
      # enter step(s) to check the 'PG' and 'R' checkboxes
      # enter step(s) to uncheck all other checkboxes
      # enter step to "submit" the search form on the homepage
      # enter step(s) to ensure that PG and R movies are visible

    And I uncheck the following ratings: G, PG-13       # features/step_definitions/movies_steps.rb:14
    And I press "ratings_submit"                        # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:52

Deprecation Warnings:

Using `should` from rspec-expectations' old `:should` syntax without explicitly enabling the syntax is deprecated. Use the new `:expect` syntax or explicitly enable `:should` with `config.expect_with(:rspec) { |c| c.syntax = :should }` instead. Called from /home/ec2-user/environment/hw-acceptance-unit-test-cycle/rottenpotatoes/spec/controllers/movies_controller_spec.rb:9:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'.


If you need more of the backtrace for any of these deprecations to
identify where to make the necessary changes, you can configure
`config.raise_errors_for_deprecations!`, and it will turn the
deprecation warnings into errors, giving you the full backtrace.
